All notable changes to Geoffrey will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.24.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- **image-gen skill**: Updated from Nano Banana Pro (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`) to Nano Banana 2 (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`) across all scripts (generate, edit, compose) and workflows

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Hook Infrastructure Expansion** - Registered all existing hooks and added new session lifecycle hooks
  - Registered 2 PreToolUse hooks: `security-validator.ts` (Write|Edit|Bash|NotebookEdit), `runtime-validator.ts` (Bash)
  - Registered 4 SessionEnd hooks: `extract-learnings.ts`, `route-to-obsidian.ts`, `capture-history.ts`, `create-daily-log.ts`
  - Total hooks: 1 SessionStart + 2 PreToolUse + 1 Stop + 5 SessionEnd = 9 registered hooks (up from 1)
- **SessionStart Hook** - `hooks/session-start/load-context.ts` loads working memory state at session start
  - Reads `~/.geoffrey/state/current-work.json` for cross-session continuity
  - Displays active task, last skill used, pending actions if state is fresh (<24h)
  - Skips silently if no state or stale state
- **Working Memory System** - 2-tier memory architecture (hot state + cold Obsidian)
  - `~/.geoffrey/state/current-work.json` for ephemeral session-to-session context
  - `hooks/session-end/save-state.ts` extracts task context, files modified, skills used, pending actions
  - 24h staleness window prevents outdated context from misleading new sessions
- **Memory Architecture Documentation** - `docs/memory-architecture.md` documents the 2-tier approach, data flow, and design decisions

## [0.23.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Runtime Validator Hook** - PreToolUse hook that blocks wrong runtimes before execution

  - Blocks `python -m` → suggests `uv run -m`
  - Splits compound commands (&&, ||, ;) and checks each segment independently
  - Strips quoted strings to avoid false positives
  - Exceptions for version checks (`node -v`, `python3 --version`) and inline exec (`python3 -c "..."`)
  - Data-driven rules config (`hooks/pre-tool-use/runtime-rules.json`)
  - 68 unit tests covering blocks, allows, compound commands, and edge cases
  - Fails open on errors (exit 0) — same pattern as security-validator
