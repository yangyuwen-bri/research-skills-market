## Philosophy

- **Learning-enabled**: Remembers your preferences with confidence scoring

- **Privacy-first**: Your data in iCloud, code in GitHub
- **Multi-machine**: Same Geoffrey, same preferences, different devices
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community contributions welcome

## Founding Principles

Geoffrey's architecture follows principles inspired by [Personal AI Infrastructure v2.0](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure). These guide all development decisions.

### 1. Scaffolding Over Model
**Architecture matters more than AI capability.**

The structure around the AI—skills, hooks, knowledge storage—determines what's possible. A well-designed scaffold makes the AI more effective; a poor one limits even the best model.

*Example:* Three-tier progressive disclosure (Tier 1: always loaded, Tier 2: on activation, Tier 3: just-in-time) keeps context lean while enabling rich capabilities.

### 2. Code Before AI
**Build deterministic CLI tools, then wrap with AI orchestration.**

Code is cheaper, faster, and more reliable than prompts. Scripts handle data fetching and processing; AI handles orchestration and natural language.

*Example:* `omnifocus-manager/scripts/get_tags.js` fetches tags deterministically. Geoffrey orchestrates when and how to use that data.

### 3. Deterministic Systems
**Favor predictable, repeatable outcomes over probabilistic behavior.**

When possible, use deterministic code paths. Reserve AI judgment for tasks that require it. Runtime data fetching ensures always-current information without stale caches.

*Example:* Fetching OmniFocus tags at runtime instead of hardcoding 129 tags that could change.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
**Load only what's needed, when it's needed.**

Context is precious. Tier 1 stays under 100 lines. Tier 2 loads when skills activate. Tier 3 fetches data just-in-time.

*Example:* OmniFocus skill loads SKILL.md on activation, fetches tags only when creating a task.

### 5. UNIX Philosophy
**Modular, composable, single responsibility.**

Each skill does one thing well. Skills compose to handle complex workflows. Clear boundaries between concerns.

*Example:* `knowledge-manager` learns preferences, `omnifocus-manager` manages tasks, `freshservice-manager` handles tickets—each focused and independent.

### 6. Self-Modifying Systems
**Infrastructure learns and improves from experience.**

Hooks extract patterns automatically. History enables preference detection. The system gets smarter over time without manual updates.

*Example:* SessionEnd hooks analyze conversations, update `learned-preferences.json`, and route summaries to Obsidian by content type.

### 7. Skill Management
**Dynamic routing with modular loading.**

SKILL.md frontmatter defines triggers. Skills activate automatically based on context. No manual switching required.

*Example:* "Add a task to OmniFocus" → `omnifocus-manager` activates. "What are my travel preferences?" → `knowledge-manager` activates.

### 8. CLI Interfaces
**Command-line tools over GUIs.**

All scripts are CLI-based for automation and composability. Use `bun` runtime for JavaScript. Standard input/output for integration.

*Example:* `bun scripts/add_task.js` creates tasks programmatically, avoiding GUI dependencies.

### 9. Identity-First Design
**Consistent personality and decision framework.**

Tier 1 identity always loaded: strengths, values, decision style. Enables personalized assistance aligned with user's cognitive patterns.

*Example:* Understanding "Green-Orange Analytical Action-Taker" profile shapes how Geoffrey presents options and makes recommendations.

### 10. Evidence-Driven Development
**Validate against code, never assume behavior.**

Always inspect before claiming. Use conservative language ("functionally validated" vs "production-ready"). Question all claims with "What evidence supports this?"

*Example:* Before saying tests pass, actually run them. Before claiming a feature works, verify in the codebase.

### Principles In Progress

- **Specification-First**: Test before implementation (improving)
- **History Systems**: Session capture and categorization (implemented in #4)
- **Science as Cognitive Loop**: Hypothesis → Experiment → Measure (future)

See [PAI v2.0's 14 Founding Principles](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure#founding-principles) for the full original framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS (for iCloud sync)
- Claude Code 2.0+
- iCloud Drive enabled
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/krishagel/geoffrey.git
cd geoffrey

# 2. Set up iCloud knowledge directory
mkdir -p ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Geoffrey/knowledge

# 3. Add as local marketplace (for development)
/plugin marketplace add ~/non-ic-code/geoffrey

# 4. Install plugin
/plugin install geoffrey@geoffrey

# 5. Verify installation
/preferences
```

## Usage

### Teaching Geoffrey

Just tell Geoffrey your preferences in natural language:

```
> "I always prefer Marriott hotels. I'm Platinum Elite."

Geoffrey: "I've learned your hotel preferences:
- Primary chain: Marriott
- Loyalty tier: Platinum Elite
- Confidence: 1.0 (explicitly stated)

Stored in knowledge base."
```

### Viewing Preferences

```
/preferences              # View all preferences
/preferences travel       # View travel preferences only
```

### Updating Preferences

```
> "Actually, I prefer aisle seats on flights"

Geoffrey: "Updated your airline preferences:
- Seat preference: Aisle (was: Window)
- Confidence: 1.0"
```

# 1. Make changes to Geoffrey files
cd ~/non-ic-code/geoffrey
# Edit skills, commands, etc.

# 2. Reload plugin
/plugin reload geoffrey

# 3. Test changes

### Knowledge File Format

**preferences.json:**
```json

  "last_updated": "2025-11-17T10:30:00Z",
  "preferences": {
    "travel": {
      "hotels": {

- Basic plugin structure
- Knowledge management skill
- /preferences command
- iCloud storage

### Phase 2: Travel Assistant (Weeks 3-4)
- Travel planning skill
- Trip planning based on preferences
- OmniFocus integration
- Points optimization

### Phase 3: Team Management (Weeks 5-6)

### Phase 4: Learning & Self-Improvement (Weeks 7-8)
- Post-conversation hooks
- Automatic preference extraction
- Pattern detection
- Confidence scoring refinement

## How It Works

### Skills Auto-Activate

Geoffrey's skills activate automatically based on what you say:

```
> "Plan my trip to Seattle"
→ travel-planning skill activates (Phase 2)

> "How is my team doing?"
→ team-management skill activates (Phase 3)

> "I prefer Marriott hotels"
→ knowledge-manager skill activates (Phase 1)
```

### Confidence Scoring

Geoffrey tracks how confident it is about each preference:

- **1.0** = You explicitly told Geoffrey
- **0.8-0.9** = Strong pattern (5+ observations)
- **0.6-0.7** = Moderate pattern (3-4 observations)
- **0.4-0.5** = Weak pattern (1-2 observations)
- **<0.4** = Insufficient data

Higher confidence preferences take priority in suggestions.

## Privacy & Security

- **Local storage**: All data in your iCloud Drive
- **No tracking**: Geoffrey doesn't send data anywhere
- **You own it**: Edit or delete knowledge files anytime
- **Open source**: Audit the code yourself
- **Encrypted**: Consider encrypting sensitive data (loyalty numbers)

## Installation

**Quick Install:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add krishagel/geoffrey
claude plugin install geoffrey@geoffrey
```
