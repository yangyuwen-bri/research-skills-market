# Geoffrey - Personal AI Infrastructure
## Product Requirements Document v2.0

**Project Name:** Geoffrey
**Tagline:** Your intelligent assistant, built as a Claude Code plugin
**Repository:** geoffrey-ai (open source, MIT License)
**Author:** Kris Hagel
**Date:** November 17, 2025 (Updated)
**Inspiration:** [Personal AI Infrastructure by Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure)

---

## Executive Summary

Geoffrey is a Claude Code plugin that provides intelligent, learning-enabled assistance across work, travel, and personal domains. Named after Geoffrey Hinton (godfather of AI) and Geoffrey from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it learns your preferences and patterns over time.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Single plugin, globally available (works from any directory)
- Skills-based architecture (auto-activate based on intent)
- Learning-enabled: Remembers preferences and patterns
- Open source: Structure public, knowledge private
- Multi-machine: Code in GitHub, knowledge syncs via iCloud/Obsidian

**Key Innovation:**
Geoffrey learns from conversations and automatically builds structured knowledge about your preferences (Marriott loyalty, Alaska Airlines, communication style) while integrating with your existing tools (OmniFocus, Gmail, Freshservice, Obsidian) through MCP servers.

### How It Works

**No Manual Context Switching:**
Geoffrey's skills automatically activate based on natural language intent:

```
User: "Plan my trip to Seattle for the conference"
→ travel-planning skill activates
→ Queries preferences.json for hotel/airline preferences
→ Checks calendar via MCP
→ Suggests options based on learned preferences

User: "How is my team doing?"
→ team-management skill activates
→ Queries Freshservice via MCP
→ Analyzes ticket patterns
→ Suggests follow-ups
```

**Learning System:**
After each conversation, hooks extract learnings and update knowledge files:

```
Conversation → Extract Patterns → Update Preferences → Increase Confidence
```

**Multi-Machine Sync:**
- Code: Pull from GitHub on each machine
- Knowledge: Syncs via iCloud automatically
- Same Geoffrey, same preferences, different locations

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Goals
1. Create working Geoffrey plugin
2. Basic knowledge storage in iCloud
3. First skill: knowledge-manager
4. Install and test locally

### Phase 1 Tasks

#### 1.1: Repository Setup

**Create structure:**
```bash
cd /path/to/geoffrey
mkdir -p .claude-plugin

  "description": "Personal AI infrastructure with learning-enabled assistance for work, travel, and personal tasks",
  "author": {
    "name": "Kris Hagel",
    "email": "hagelk@psd401.net"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/geoffrey-ai",
  "keywords": ["personal-ai", "learning", "preferences", "assistant"],
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

#### 1.3: Knowledge Manager Skill

- Allows editing/updating
- Displays confidence scores

#### 1.5: iCloud Knowledge Directory

**Setup:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Geoffrey/knowledge
```

**Initial `preferences.json`:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-11-17T00:00:00Z",
  "preferences": {}
}
```

#### 1.6: Installation & Testing

**Install locally:**
```bash

## Phase 2: Travel Assistant (Weeks 3-4)

### Goals
1. Build travel-planning skill
2. Integrate with OmniFocus MCP
3. Test preference learning
4. Create travel-planner agent

### Components

**`skills/travel-planning/SKILL.md`:**
- Plan trips based on learned preferences
- Search for hotels (prioritize Marriott)
- Search for flights (prioritize Alaska)
- Calculate points optimization
- Create OmniFocus tasks

**Preference Categories:**
```json
{
  "travel": {
    "hotels": {
      "primary_chain": "Marriott",
      "tier": "Platinum Elite",
      "room_preferences": ["high floor", "away from elevator"],
      "confidence": 1.0
    },
    "airlines": {
      "primary": "Alaska Airlines",
      "tier": "MVP Gold",
      "seat_preference": "aisle",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Team Management (Weeks 5-6)

### Goals
1. Build team-management skill
2. Integrate Freshservice MCP
3. Create employee assistance workflows
4. Test work-related learning

### Components

**`skills/team-management/SKILL.md`:**
- Check employee ticket status
- Identify overdue items
- Suggest follow-up actions
- Create OmniFocus tasks for management

---

## Phase 4: Learning & Self-Improvement (Weeks 7-8)

### Goals
1. Implement post-conversation hook
2. Build pattern detection
3. Create confidence scoring system
4. Enable self-improvement suggestions

### Learning Pipeline

```
Conversation → Hook Triggers → Extract Preferences → Confidence Check → Update Storage
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
- 1.0 = Explicitly stated by user
- 0.8-0.9 = Strong pattern (5+ observations)
- 0.6-0.7 = Moderate pattern (3-4 observations)
- 0.4-0.5 = Weak pattern (1-2 observations)
- <0.4 = Insufficient data

---

## Technical Specifications

### Context Management Architecture

**CRITICAL:** Keep context lean using three-tier progressive disclosure.

| Tier | What | When Loaded | Size Guideline |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | preferences.json | Always active | 50-100 lines max |
| **Tier 2** | SKILL.md | Skill activates | Comprehensive |
| **Tier 3** | Scripts/data | Just-in-time | Fetch on-demand |

**Why this matters:** As Geoffrey learns more, preferences could bloat and fill context windows. By keeping preferences lean (behavioral rules only) and fetching data on-demand via scripts, we maintain performance regardless of how much Geoffrey knows.

**Preferences = Behavioral rules only:**
```json
{
  "omnifocus_philosophy": {
    "task_creation": "Always assign to project + due date"
  }
}
```

**NOT data dumps:**
```json
// WRONG - don't do this
{
  "all_129_tags": [...huge array...]
}
```

**Code over prompts:** Build deterministic scripts, wrap with AI orchestration. Code is cheaper, faster, and more reliable than prompts.

### Plugin Format (Claude Code Standard)

Geoffrey uses Claude Code's standard plugin format:

```
geoffrey/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   ├── plugin.json          # Required: metadata
│   └── marketplace.json     # Required: distribution
├── skills/                  # Auto-activated capabilities
├── commands/                # Explicit user commands
├── agents/                  # Specialized workers
└── hooks/                   # Event triggers
```

### Skills vs Commands

**Skills** (auto-activate):
- Claude decides when to use based on context
- User doesn't explicitly invoke
- Example: travel-planning activates when user mentions trips

**Commands** (user-invoked):
- User explicitly calls via `/command`
- Example: `/preferences` to view settings

### Knowledge Storage

**Format:** JSON files in iCloud
**Location:** `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Geoffrey/knowledge/`
**Sync:** Automatic via iCloud
**Encryption:** Consider for sensitive data (loyalty numbers, etc.)

**preferences.json structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "preferences": {
    "category": {
      "key": "value",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "learned_from": ["source1", "source2"]
    }
  }
}
```

**memory.jsonl structure:**
```jsonl
{"timestamp":"ISO-8601","query":"...","learned":["preference1"],"confidence_updates":{}}
```

### External Integrations

Geoffrey uses a hybrid approach for integrations:

**Custom Scripts (preferred for control):**
- OmniFocus - JXA scripts in skills for full tag hierarchy access
- Rationale: Existing MCP servers truncate data, can't get tag groupings

**MCP Servers (where they work well):**
- Obsidian MCP
- Gmail MCP
- Freshservice MCP (may need to build)

**Design principle:** If MCP server gives what we need, use it. If not, write our own scripts inside skills for full control.
